## Our Story: A Commitment Forged in the Classroom

GC Education Analytics LLC was founded by Gerardo Castillo, stemming from a deep-seated belief in the transformative power of education and a firsthand understanding of the challenges educators face. After graduating from Harvard in 2018 and serving with Teach For America in Oklahoma City, Gerardo has continued his career as a dedicated teacher. This immersive experience in the classroom illuminated the significant administrative load and data-related hurdles that can divert educators' energy from their core passion: teaching and connecting with students. It became clear that there was a profound opportunity to leverage technology thoughtfully to free up educators' time and unlock the true potential within their existing data. Our journey began with a simple question: How can we make data work *for* schools, not the other way around?

## Our Approach & Philosophy: Expertise Meets Empathy

Led by Gerardo Castillo, GC Education Analytics operates at the intersection of robust analytical skill and genuine educational insight. Gerardo's academic journey at Harvard, where he majored in Molecular and Cellular Biology, provided a strong foundation in rigorous research, systematic thinking, and detailed analysis – skills honed through practical lab work. While at Harvard, he also gained foundational exposure to computer science principles. This initial interest in computational thinking was later expanded through a dedicated pursuit of data analytics knowledge via various online courses, driven by a passion for problem-solving and efficiency.

This unique analytical and research background is powerfully combined with real-world, on-the-ground experience. As an ongoing classroom teacher who began his educational career with Teach For America in Oklahoma City, Gerardo intimately understands the daily realities, pressures, and profound rewards of working within a school system. This isn't just about algorithms and databases; it's about understanding the 'why' behind the data – the students, the teachers, and the community. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Curriculum and Instruction, Gerardo is further deepening his commitment to pedagogical excellence and ensuring that all data solutions are grounded in sound educational principles.

Our philosophy is built on a few key pillars:
