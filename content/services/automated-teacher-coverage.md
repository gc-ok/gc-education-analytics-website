## The Challenge: The Daily Scramble for Coverage

Finding coverage for absent teachers is a constant, time-consuming challenge for school administrators. Last-minute all-staff emails, complex spreadsheets, and endless communication threads often lead to:
* Lost instructional time for students.
* Increased administrative burden on office staff and administrators.
* Frustration for teachers asked to cover during their planning periods with little notice or autonomy.
* Inequitable distribution of coverage assignments.
* Difficulty in tracking coverage assignments and associated stipends.

## Our Solution: Streamlined, Automated, and Empowering with Google Sheets

GC Education Analytics offers a program that transforms your in-house teacher coverage process from a reactive scramble to a proactive, efficient, and transparent system, leveraging the power and familiarity of **Google Sheets and Google Apps Script.**

**Key Features & Workflow:**

1.  **Absence Reporting:** Teachers report upcoming absences through a simple interface.
2.  **Automated Opportunity Posting:** Available coverage slots are automatically posted to eligible internal staff based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., subject, planning period availability) via a **personalized webpage for each teacher.**
3.  **Teacher Autonomy & Sign-Up:** Teachers can view and select coverage opportunities that fit their schedule and preferences directly from their webpage.
4.  **Automated Email Confirmations:** Instant confirmation emails are sent (using **your school's Gmail system**) to covering teachers, administrators, and relevant staff once a slot is filled.
5.  **Centralized Tracking in Google Sheets:** All coverage assignments, teacher availability, substitute tracking, and stipend information (if applicable) are managed and tracked in a **centralized, tailored Google Sheet**, simplifying payroll and record-keeping.
6.  **Fairness & Transparency:** Clear visibility into available slots and assignments for all involved staff.
7.  **No Extra Software:** The entire system operates within your existing Google Workspace environment. No need to download or learn new, complex software.

## How It Works: Simple Setup, Powerful Results

We've designed the setup process to be straightforward and secure, ensuring your data remains private and under your control.

1.  **Provide Your Master Schedule:**
    * You can either send us your Master Schedule directly or, if privacy is a primary concern, provide a screenshot with any sensitive student information removed or blacked out. This helps us tailor the initial spreadsheet structure.

2.  **Receive & Copy Your Custom Spreadsheet:**
    * We will prepare and send you a Google Sheet specifically configured for your Master Schedule.
    * You simply **make a copy** of this spreadsheet into your own Google Drive. This ensures you are the owner and have full control.

3.  **Share a Link (View-Only for Setup Authorization):**
    * You will share the link of *your copied spreadsheet* back with us. **Importantly, we do *not* need edit or even view permissions on your actual data.**
    * This link is used solely to grant *your specific spreadsheet* permission to use the underlying Google Apps Script code that powers the automation. This crucial step ensures only your authorized spreadsheet can run the integrated functions.

4.  **Fill in Teacher Information:**
    * In your copied spreadsheet, you'll enter essential details like Teacher Names, IDs (if applicable), Email Addresses, and Classes Taught into the designated columns and cells.

5.  **Final Quick Setup (App Script Editor):**
    * A few quick steps (around 10 clicks) are needed within the Google Apps Script editor associated with your spreadsheet to generate the necessary webpage URLs for teacher sign-ups.
    * We provide clear instructions, or if you prefer, we can handle this step for you with temporary access *after* you've inputted all your sensitive teacher data (so we wouldn't see that data).

**And that’s it—your automated teacher coverage system is ready to go!**

## Data Privacy & Security: Our Commitment

We understand the paramount importance of student and staff data privacy. Our system is designed with the following safeguards:

* **You Own Your Data:** All your school's information (teacher details, schedules, coverage assignments) resides solely within **your own Google Sheet** in your Google Workspace environment.
* **No External Data Storage:** We do not store any of your school's operational data on our servers or any third-party platforms.
* **Secure Code Execution:** The automation logic is powered by Google Apps Script. When you execute a function (e.g., by clicking a menu item in your spreadsheet), *your Google account* runs the script, using our code as instructions. We do not have direct access to your spreadsheet, emails, or any data during its operation. The script acts on your behalf, within your environment.
* **Limited Setup Access (Optional & Temporary):** The only instance where we might need temporary access is if you explicitly request us to complete the final App Script Editor setup steps for you, and this would be after you've populated your data.
