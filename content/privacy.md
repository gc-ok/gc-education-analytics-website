## 1. Introduction
**GCEducationAnalytics LLC** ("we," "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data across two distinct areas of our business:
1.  **Website Visitors & Pilot Applicants:** Information we collect when you visit our website or sign up for services.
2.  **Software Products:** How our "client-hosted" software architecture handles student and district data.

# Part I: Website & Business Operations
*(Applies to visitors of gceducationanalytics.com and prospective clients)*

* **Name**
* **School/District Name**
* **Email Address**
* **Job Title**

### 3. How We Use This Information
We use this data solely for business operations, including:
* Contacting you regarding your application for the Pilot Program.
* Scheduling onboarding calls or demos.
* Sending product updates or resources (only if you have explicitly opted in).
* Verifying software licensing.

* **GitHub Pages:** Website hosting.

* **Tally / Google Forms:** Contact form submissions.

# Part II: Software Products & Student Data
*(Applies to school districts using our scripts and analytics tools)*

### 5. Architecture & Data Possession ("No-Transfer" Model)
Our software solutions, including the **School Analytics Dashboard**, operate under a unique **"Privacy-First"** architecture designed to keep student data within the School District's control.

* **Deployment:** Our software code is installed and executed entirely within the District's own Google Workspace tenant.
* **Data Residency:** All data processed by our tools remains physically and logically stored within the District's Google Drive, Google Sheets, and Google Cloud environment.
* **No Data Transfer:** At no point does student or staff Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leave the District’s controlled environment to be transmitted to GCEducationAnalytics LLC servers.

### 6. Student Data (FERPA & COPPA)
Because our software runs in your environment, **GCEducationAnalytics LLC collects NO Student PII.**

* **Collection:** We do not collect, view, store, or process student names, grades, IDs, or demographic info on Vendor-owned infrastructure.
* **FERPA Compliance:** Our software acts as a tool under the direct control of the School District. Because we do not maintain the data, the District retains full ownership and control, simplifying FERPA compliance.
* **COPPA:** Our tools are administrative. We do not market to children under 13, nor do we operate websites that collect personal information from children.

### 7. Security
Security is a shared responsibility. Because our code operates within your Google Workspace, the security of the data is primarily governed by your district's security settings.
* **Vendor Responsibility:** We employ secure coding practices (OWASP guidelines), require only the minimum necessary permissions (Least Privilege), and protect our source code with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
* **Client Responsibility:** The District is responsible for managing access controls, sharing permissions, and the general security settings of their Google Workspace domain.

### 8. Data Access & Deletion
Since GCEducationAnalytics LLC does not possess the District’s data, we cannot directly delete or modify student records.
* **Retention:** Data retention is determined solely by the District’s own Google Workspace policies.
* **Termination:** Upon termination of service, the District may simply remove the provided scripts and files from their Google Drive. No further action is required from us as we hold no copy of the production data.
