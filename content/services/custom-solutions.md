## The Challenge
Off-the-shelf platforms can’t accommodate granular policy or local customizations, forcing staff into workarounds.

---

## How It Works
1. **Discovery Workshop:** Map current workflows and pain points.
2. **Prototyping:** Wireframes and MVP mockups for rapid feedback.
3. **Development:** Agile sprints using Google Apps Script, React, or Flask.
4. **Deployment & Training:** Hosted on Google Workspace, Firebase, or containerized.

## Technical Details
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind or Google Apps Script UI
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore) or PostgreSQL
- **APIs:** Google Workspace, RESTful endpoints in Flask
- **Auth:** OAuth2 via Google, role-based access

## Impact
- Automate routine tasks → recover hours per week
