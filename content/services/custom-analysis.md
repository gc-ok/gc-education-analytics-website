## The Challenge
Standard reports fail to differentiate question quality, subgroup performance, and trend significance.

---

## How It Works
1. **Data Processing:** Clean and normalize exports from Canvas, Mastery Connect, PowerSchool.
2. **Diagnostic Analysis:** Difficulty index, point-biserial, distractor analysis, IRT modeling.
3. **Visualization:** Heatmaps, ICC plots, subgroup comparisons, longitudinal trend graphs.
4. **Delivery:** Google Sheets dashboards, Looker Studio, or Excel workbooks with macros.
