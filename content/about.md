</figure>




My name is Gerardo Castillo. The vision for GC Education Analytics LLC stems from a deep-seated belief in the transformative power of education and a firsthand understanding of the challenges educators face. After graduating from Harvard in 2018 and serving with Teach For America in Oklahoma City, I have continued my career as a dedicated teacher.

This immersive experience in the classroom illuminated the significant administrative load and data-related hurdles that can divert energy from the core passion of teaching and connecting with students. It became clear that there was a profound opportunity to leverage technology thoughtfully—to free up educators' time and unlock the true potential within their existing data. My journey began with a simple question: How can we make data work *for* schools, not the other way around?

My approach is built on the intersection of robust analytical skill and genuine educational insight. My academic background in Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard provided a strong foundation in rigorous research and systematic thinking. While there, I also gained foundational exposure to computer science principles, an interest later expanded through a dedicated pursuit of data analytics knowledge, driven by a passion for problem-solving and efficiency.

This analytical foundation is powerfully combined with my real-world, on-the-ground experience as an ongoing classroom teacher. I intimately understand the daily realities, pressures, and profound rewards of working within a school system. For me, this isn't just about algorithms; it's about understanding the 'why' behind the data – the students, the teachers, and the community. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Curriculum and Instruction, I am further deepening my commitment to pedagogical excellence, ensuring all solutions are grounded in sound educational principles and designed with the educator always in mind.
