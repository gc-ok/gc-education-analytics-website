## The Challenge
Coordinating teacher coverage through email chains and scattered spreadsheets wastes administrator time and leads to last-minute confusion.

---

## How It Works
1. Teachers declare availability via a **Google Form** or embedded web app tied to their planning periods.
2. A **queue-based algorithm** prioritizes assignments by:
   - Coverage balance (frequency per teacher)
   - Alignment with department and grade-level needs
   - Time-bound triggers resetting availability daily
3. Assignments are:
   - Auto-notified via email/SMS
   - Recorded in a centralized Google Sheet or database
   - Monitored by administrators through a live dashboard

## Technical Details
- **Frontend:** Google Apps Script UI or React SPA
- **Backend:** Google Sheets API or Firestore via Apps Script
- **Notifications:** Gmail API, Twilio SMS integration
- **Logic:** App Script triggers (`PropertiesService`, `ClockTrigger`) and queue sorting

```python
# Example pseudocode for scheduling logic
availability = fetchTeacherAvailability()
queue = sortByMetrics(availability)
assignments = distributeCoverage(queue)
notifyTeachers(assignments)
logAssignments(assignments)
