# At-Risk Student Analysis & Intervention

Predict academic risks before they materialize, enabling timely, data-driven interventions for your most vulnerable learners.

## The Challenge
Traditional early warning systems generate high false-positive rates and lack specificity to your school’s unique data patterns.

---

## How It Works
1. **Data Ingestion**: Attendance, grades, test scores, disciplinary records.
2. **Model Training**: Classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
3. **Risk Scoring**: Each student receives a risk probability score and assigned tier.
4. **Dashboard**: Color-coded alerts by student, course, and subgroup with drill-down capability.

## Why It Works
- {{< icon "check" >}} **Customized Models:** Trained on your historical data.
- {{< icon "check" >}} **Explainable AI:** Feature importance and SHAP values for transparency.
- {{< icon "check" >}} **Automated Alerts:** Integration with Sheets, email, or API triggers.

## Technical Details
- **Languages:** Python (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, `shap`)
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, optional XGBoost
- **Validation:** K-fold CV, ROC-AUC, F1-score metrics
- **Deployment:** Persist models with `joblib`; schedule retraining via Cloud Functions

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
risk_scores = model.predict_proba(X_new)[:, 1]
```

## Impact
- Detect risks **3–6 weeks earlier**
- Scale interventions across cohorts
- Improve graduation and retention rates
