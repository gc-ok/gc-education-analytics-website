GC Education Analytics never has access to this data. Runs As You: When you use the web app or functions in the sheet, the Google Apps Script runs under your Google account\u0026rsquo;s authority. Email (If Applicable for Future Features): If any features were to send emails (e.g., summaries to yourself), they would be sent via your Gmail account, under your control. No External Data Storage: The tool is self-contained within your Google Sheet and the associated Apps Script.

Our Founder\u0026rsquo;s Story \u0026amp; Approach: Gerardo Castillo # Gerardo Castillo, founder of GC Education Analytics LLC My name is Gerardo Castillo. The vision for GC Education Analytics LLC stems from a deep-seated belief in the transformative power of education and a firsthand understanding of the challenges educators face. After graduating from Harvard in 2018 and serving with Teach For America in Oklahoma City, I have continued my career as a dedicated teacher.\nThis immersive experience in the classroom illuminated the significant administrative load and data-related hurdles that can divert energy from the core passion of teaching and connecting with students. It became clear that there was a profound opportunity to leverage technology thoughtfully—to free up educators\u0026rsquo; time and unlock the true potential within their existing data. My journey began with a simple question: How can we make data work for schools, not the other way around?\nMy approach is built on the intersection of robust analytical skill and genuine educational insight. My academic background in Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard provided a strong foundation in rigorous research and systematic thinking. While there, I also gained foundational exposure to computer science principles, an interest later expanded through a dedicated pursuit of data analytics knowledge, driven by a passion for problem-solving and efficiency.\nThis analytical foundation is powerfully combined with my real-world, on-the-ground experience as an ongoing classroom teacher. I intimately understand the daily realities, pressures, and profound rewards of working within a school system. For me, this isn\u0026rsquo;t just about algorithms; it\u0026rsquo;s about understanding the \u0026lsquo;why\u0026rsquo; behind the data – the students, the teachers, and the community. Currently pursuing a Master\u0026rsquo;s degree in Curriculum and Instruction, I am further deepening my commitment to pedagogical excellence, ensuring all solutions are grounded in sound educational principles and designed with the educator always in mind.\nPartner with Us # We are excited about the potential to help your school harness the power of its data to create a more connected and efficient educational environment.

Advanced Data Analysis \u0026amp; Strategic Reporting # Unlock the full potential of your school\u0026rsquo;s data. We move beyond surface-level graphs to provide robust statistical analysis, uncovering significant trends, correlations, and comparisons that inform high-impact strategies.\nRequest a Data Consultation The Challenge: Data Rich, Insight Poor? # Many schools collect vast amounts of data from standardized tests, student performance metrics, demographic information, and operational systems. However, without specialized analytical expertise, it can be challenging to:\nMove beyond simple averages and descriptive summaries. Determine if observed differences between groups or changes over time are statistically significant. Understand the complex interplay between various factors influencing student outcomes. Effectively model and interpret assessment data using advanced psychometric techniques. Translate raw data into clear, compelling narratives that drive strategic action. Our Solution: Illuminating Your Data\u0026rsquo;s Story # GC Education Analytics provides expert data analysis services tailored to your school\u0026rsquo;s specific questions and strategic priorities. We help you understand not just what your data says, but why it matters and how you can act on it.\nOur Analytical Capabilities Include:\nStatistical Significance Testing: Determine if observed differences (e.g., in test scores between programs, or year-over-year changes) are real or due to chance. Correlation \u0026amp; Regression Analysis: Identify relationships between variables (e.g., how attendance correlates with achievement, or which factors best predict college readiness). Comparative Analysis: In-depth comparisons between different student subgroups, programs, teaching methodologies, or schools (within a district). Heatmaps \u0026amp; Advanced Visualizations: Create compelling visual representations of complex data patterns. Standardized Test Score Analysis: Deep dives into performance by standard, sub-skill, and demographic group. Teacher and classroom-level comparisons (with appropriate context and fairness considerations). Growth modeling and value-added analysis. Item Response Theory (IRT) Modeling: For schools using assessments where IRT is applicable, we can provide more nuanced analysis of item difficulty, student ability, and test characteristics. This can inform curriculum adjustments and assessment design. (This is a more specialized offering.) Custom Report Generation: Developing clear, concise, and actionable reports tailored to different stakeholders (administrators, teachers, school boards). The Process:\nGoal Definition: We start by understanding your key questions and what you aim to achieve with data analysis. Data Preparation \u0026amp; Cleaning: Ensuring data quality and integrity for robust analysis. Appropriate Method Selection: Choosing the right statistical techniques for your specific data and research questions. In-Depth Analysis \u0026amp; Interpretation: Performing the analysis and, crucially, interpreting the results in the context of your school. Clear Reporting \u0026amp; Recommendations: Presenting findings in an understandable format with actionable recommendations. Why Our Data Analysis Services Stand Out # Educational Context: Our analysis is always grounded in an understanding of school environments and educational goals. Statistical Rigor: We employ appropriate and robust statistical methods. Beyond Surface-Level: We dig deeper to find the nuanced insights that can drive real change. Clear Communication: We translate complex findings into clear, actionable language for all stakeholders. Customized to Your Needs: Analysis is tailored to the specific questions your school needs to answer. Technical Details (Conceptual \u0026amp; Example) # Our analyses primarily utilize powerful statistical software and programming languages.\nMethodologies: Depending on the research question, we employ a range of statistical techniques including (but not limited to) t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests, correlation analysis, multiple regression, logistic regression (as detailed in our At-Risk Analysis service), factor analysis, and IRT models. Focus on Interpretation: While the statistical methods are important, our primary focus is on the correct application and, most importantly, the practical interpretation of the results within your educational context. For instance, when comparing the effectiveness of two different instructional programs, we might use an independent samples t-test to determine if there\u0026rsquo;s a statistically significant difference in mean student achievement scores. The formula for the t-statistic (when variances are assumed equal) is: $$ t = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2)}{s_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}} $$ Where:\n\\(\\bar{X}_1\\) and \\(\\bar{X}_2\\) are the sample means of the two groups. \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) are the sample sizes of the two groups. \\(s_p\\) is the pooled standard deviation. A significant t-statistic (and its associated p-value) would help determine if one program is more effective than the other.\nAnticipated Impact \u0026amp; Outcomes # Our advanced data analysis services can help your school:\nMake more confident, evidence-based strategic decisions. Identify effective programs and practices for replication. Target resources more effectively to areas of greatest need or potential impact. Improve understanding of student performance and equity gaps. Enhance accountability and reporting to stakeholders.

Last-minute all-staff emails, complex spreadsheets, and endless communication threads often lead to:\nLost instructional time for students. Increased administrative burden on office staff and administrators. Frustration for teachers asked to cover during their planning periods with little notice or autonomy. Inequitable distribution of coverage assignments. Difficulty in tracking coverage assignments and associated stipends. Our Solution: Streamlined, Automated, and Empowering with Google Sheets # GC Education Analytics offers a program that transforms your in-house teacher coverage process from a reactive scramble to a proactive, efficient, and transparent system, leveraging the power and familiarity of Google Sheets and Google Apps Script.\nKey Features \u0026amp; Workflow:\nAbsence Reporting: Teachers report upcoming absences through a simple interface. Automated Opportunity Posting: Available coverage slots are automatically posted to eligible internal staff based on pre-defined criteria (e.g., subject, planning period availability) via a personalized webpage for each teacher. Teacher Autonomy \u0026amp; Sign-Up: Teachers can view and select coverage opportunities that fit their schedule and preferences directly from their webpage. Automated Email Confirmations: Instant confirmation emails are sent (using your school\u0026rsquo;s Gmail system) to covering teachers, administrators, and relevant staff once a slot is filled. Centralized Tracking in Google Sheets: All coverage assignments, teacher availability, substitute tracking, and stipend information (if applicable) are managed and tracked in a centralized, tailored Google Sheet, simplifying payroll and record-keeping. Fairness \u0026amp; Transparency: Clear visibility into available slots and assignments for all involved staff. No Extra Software: The entire system operates within your existing Google Workspace environment. No need to download or learn new, complex software. How It Works: Simple Setup, Powerful Results # We\u0026rsquo;ve designed the setup process to be straightforward and secure, ensuring your data remains private and under your control.\nProvide Your Master Schedule:\nYou can either send us your Master Schedule directly or, if privacy is a primary concern, provide a screenshot with any sensitive student information removed or blacked out. This helps us tailor the initial spreadsheet structure. Receive \u0026amp; Copy Your Custom Spreadsheet:\nWe will prepare and send you a Google Sheet specifically configured for your Master Schedule. You simply make a copy of this spreadsheet into your own Google Drive. This ensures you are the owner and have full control. Share a Link (View-Only for Setup Authorization):\nYou will share the link of your copied spreadsheet back with us. Importantly, we do not need edit or even view permissions on your actual data. This link is used solely to grant your specific spreadsheet permission to use the underlying Google Apps Script code that powers the automation. This crucial step ensures only your authorized spreadsheet can run the integrated functions. Fill in Teacher Information:\nIn your copied spreadsheet, you\u0026rsquo;ll enter essential details like Teacher Names, IDs (if applicable), Email Addresses, and Classes Taught into the designated columns and cells. Final Quick Setup (App Script Editor):\nA few quick steps (around 10 clicks) are needed within the Google Apps Script editor associated with your spreadsheet to generate the necessary webpage URLs for teacher sign-ups. We provide clear instructions, or if you prefer, we can handle this step for you with temporary access after you\u0026rsquo;ve inputted all your sensitive teacher data (so we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t see that data). And that’s it—your automated teacher coverage system is ready to go!\nData Privacy \u0026amp; Security: Our Commitment # We understand the paramount importance of student and staff data privacy. Our system is designed with the following safeguards:\nYou Own Your Data: All your school\u0026rsquo;s information (teacher details, schedules, coverage assignments) resides solely within your own Google Sheet in your Google Workspace environment.

Our AI-powered analysis enables your school to implement timely, data-driven interventions, fostering success for your most vulnerable learners.\nRequest a Personalized Preview The Challenge: Unseen Obstacles to Student Success # Research indicates that a confluence of factors, including socio-economic background, attendance patterns, and even historical systemic biases reflected in ethnicity-based outcome disparities, can influence student achievement. Schools possess a wealth of data on these aspects, yet transforming this raw data into actionable, equitable strategies to support every student remains a significant hurdle. Many at-risk students may not display obvious warning signs until intervention is difficult or less effective.\nThis program is designed to move beyond reactive measures. By applying machine learning models tailored to your school\u0026rsquo;s unique data, we can identify underlying patterns and predict which students may face academic challenges, even before those challenges become apparent in grades or behavior.\nThis allows your school to proactively:\nSort and filter students based on predictive risk scores. Implement targeted interventions for specific student populations. Uncover \u0026ldquo;silently failing\u0026rdquo; students who may appear engaged but are struggling due to hidden factors. Identify students who are outperforming predictions, providing opportunities to learn from their resilience. For example, if your school aims to reduce course failure rates, a predictive model can be developed. This model analyzes variables such as attendance, tardies, disciplinary incidents, school engagement metrics, and socio-economic indicators to forecast the probability of a student failing a class. The resulting risk scores enable focused support for:\nStudents currently exhibiting warning signs (e.g., poor grades, low attendance). Students not yet failing but predicted to be at high risk (e.g., those with high absenteeism who are currently passing but may soon falter). Students who are unexpectedly failing despite positive indicators (e.g., good attendance and behavior), who may require deeper, more personalized support. How Our System Works: A Clear Path to Intervention # Comprehensive Data Ingestion: We securely work with your existing data sources, including attendance records, current and historical grades, standardized test scores, disciplinary logs, and other relevant student information. Data can be managed via shared Google Sheets or local Excel files, ensuring your data remains within your control and is not stored on external third-party servers. Custom Model Development \u0026amp; Training: Using your school\u0026rsquo;s historical data, we train and validate sophisticated machine learning models. This typically involves classification algorithms suited for predicting student outcomes. Individualized Risk Scoring: Each student receives a precise risk probability score, often categorized into tiers (e.g., low, moderate, high risk) for ease of interpretation and action. Actionable Dashboard \u0026amp; Reporting: Insights are presented in an intuitive, color-coded dashboard. View risk by student, course, or demographic subgroup, with drill-down capabilities to understand the contributing factors. Periodic Analysis \u0026amp; Progress Monitoring: The analysis is typically performed periodically (e.g., quarterly, semesterly) to track changes over time, measure the impact of interventions, and recalibrate models as new data becomes available. Facilitating Targeted Intervention: Armed with these insights, your team can implement focused support strategies. Tasks can be automated (e.g., personalized email notifications to students, parents, counselors, and/or teachers) to aid your intervention workflows efficiently. Why Our Approach is Effective # Tailored to Your School: Models are custom-built using your historical data, reflecting the unique context and specific predictors relevant to your student population, rather than generic, one-size-fits-all approaches. Proactive \u0026amp; Preventative: Identify at-risk students weeks or even months earlier than traditional methods, allowing for more effective and less intensive interventions. Action-Oriented Insights: We focus on providing clear, interpretable results that directly inform intervention strategies and resource allocation. Data Security Focused: Your student data remains under your control, utilizing secure and familiar platforms like Google Sheets or local files. Automated Support: Optional integration with communication tools can streamline parts of your intervention workflow, ensuring timely outreach. Anticipated Impact \u0026amp; Outcomes # By implementing a tailored At-Risk Student Analysis system, your institution can expect:\nEarlier Detection: Identify students needing support 3–6 weeks (or more) sooner than traditional methods. Efficient Resource Allocation: Focus intervention resources on students who need them most, based on predictive insights rather than solely on lagging indicators. Scalable Interventions: Implement and track interventions more effectively across larger student cohorts. Improved Student Outcomes: Contribute to increased student engagement, better academic performance, higher retention, and improved graduation rates. Data-Driven Culture: Foster a more proactive, data-informed culture among your staff. Technical Details: Under the Hood # Feel free to read the following section if you would like some more information on how machine learning models are used in the at-risk analysis\nOur analytical approach leverages established machine learning techniques to provide reliable and interpretable predictions.\nCore Methodologies:\nMachine learning, at its heart, involves training a computer model to learn patterns from historical data. Once trained, this model can then make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. For at-risk student identification, we typically frame this as a classification problem: will a student fall into an \u0026ldquo;at-risk\u0026rdquo; category (e.g., fail a course, not meet a benchmark) or not? (Note, however, that different models can be used based on the student outcome your school wishes to predict and do more of a deep-dive.)\nThe process generally involves:\nFeature Engineering: Selecting and preparing the relevant data points (variables like attendance, prior grades, disciplinary incidents, demographic information) that might influence student outcomes. This step is crucial and is done in collaboration with your school to ensure we use meaningful and appropriate data. Model Selection: Choosing appropriate algorithms. Common starting points include: Logistic Regression: A statistical model that predicts the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., pass/fail). It\u0026rsquo;s interpretable and provides insights into which factors are most predictive. Random Forests: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple \u0026ldquo;decision trees\u0026rdquo; and combines their outputs. It\u0026rsquo;s robust, handles complex relationships in data well, and can identify important predictive features. (A random forest combines many diverse decision tree \u0026ldquo;flowcharts\u0026rdquo; to make an accurate and stable prediction.) Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost): More advanced ensemble methods that can offer higher accuracy, often used when predictive power is paramount. Training \u0026amp; Validation: The selected model is \u0026ldquo;trained\u0026rdquo; on a portion of your historical data. We then rigorously test (validate) its performance on a separate portion of data it hasn\u0026rsquo;t seen before to ensure it generalizes well and isn\u0026rsquo;t just \u0026ldquo;memorizing\u0026rdquo; the training data. Common validation techniques include k-fold cross-validation. Performance is measured using metrics like Area Under the ROC Curve (ROC-AUC), F1-score, precision, and recall, chosen based on the specific goals. Interpretability: Understanding why a model makes certain predictions is crucial in education. We use techniques and contextual analysis to help explain which factors are driving individual student risk scores. Key Concepts in Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression Example):\nLogistic Regression is a statistical method used to predict a binary outcome (e.g., at-risk/not at-risk) by estimating probabilities. It uses the logistic function to transform a linear combination of input features into a probability score.\nThe logit function (representing the log-odds of being at risk) is modeled as a linear sum of predictors: $$ \\text{logit}(p) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_n x_n $$\nWhere:\n\\(p\\) is the probability of the student being at risk. \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept term. \\(\\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_n\\) are the coefficients corresponding to each predictor variable \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\) (e.g., attendance rate, previous GPA). These coefficients help understand the influence of each factor. The probability \\(p\\) is then derived using the logistic function: $$ p = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\text{logit}(p))}} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_n x_n)}} $$ This resulting probability \\(p\\) serves as the student\u0026rsquo;s risk score.\n","date":"28 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/services/at-risk-analysis/","section":"Our Services","summary":"\u003c!-- Calendly badge widget begin --\u003e\n\u003clink href=\"https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"\u003e\n\u003cscript src=\"https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js\" type=\"text/javascript\" async\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\"\u003ewindow.onload = function() { Calendly.initBadgeWidget({ url: 'https://calendly.com/gcastillo-gceducationanalytics', text: 'Schedule a meeting', color: '#0069ff', textColor: '#ffffff', branding: true }); }\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c!-- Calendly badge widget end --\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n \u003cdiv class=\"text-center\"\u003e\n\n  \u003cfigure\u003e\n          \u003cimg\n            class=\"my-0 rounded-md mx-auto mb-8 rounded-lg shadow-lg\"\n            srcset=\"\n            /images/at-risk-dashboard_hu_aecac2054f2a5c2e.png 330w,\n            /images/at-risk-dashboard_hu_c4e95cda14c2ed5c.png 660w,\n            /images/at-risk-dashboard_hu_38c779583c72fc02.png 1024w,\n            /images/at-risk-dashboard_hu_a6c7ff4612cfc27c.png 2x\"\n            src=\"/images/at-risk-dashboard_hu_c4e95cda14c2ed5c.png\"\n            data-zoom-src=\"/images/at-risk-dashboard_hu_a6c7ff4612cfc27c.png\"\n            alt=\"Predictive At-Risk Student Dashboard\"\n          /\u003e\n    \n    \n    \u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"At-Risk Student Analysis \u0026 Intervention","type":"services"},{"content":"Your message has been successfully submitted.\nWe appreciate you contacting us and will get back to you as soon as possible.\nReturn to Homepage\n","date":"28 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/thank-you/","section":"GC Education Analytics LLC: Empowering Educators Through Data","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour message has been successfully submitted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe appreciate you contacting us and will get back to you as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/\"\u003eReturn to Homepage\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Thank You!","type":"page"},{"content":" At GC Education Analytics LLC, we offer specialized solutions to meet the unique data and software needs of educational institutions.\nIn-House Teacher Coverage Program # Streamline the process of finding coverage for absent teachers.
