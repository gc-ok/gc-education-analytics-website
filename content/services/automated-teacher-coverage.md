## The Challenge: The Daily Scramble for Coverage

Finding coverage for absent teachers is a constant, time-consuming challenge for school administrators. Last-minute all-staff emails, complex spreadsheets, and endless communication threads often lead to:
* Lost instructional time for students.
* Increased administrative burden on office staff and administrators.
* Frustration for teachers who are asked to cover during their planning periods with little notice or autonomy.
* Inequitable distribution of coverage assignments.
* Difficulty in tracking coverage assignments and associated stipends.
